This is the library of trading strategies
It will ultimately make the decisions for when to execute a trade

Once the manager finds an entry or exit point based on :
    if strategy is on buy:
        look for entry point
    else:
        look for exit point

it will return a trade directive object and pipe it to the Trader

Flow:
Market data -> Manager -> Trade directive -> Trader -> Trade
